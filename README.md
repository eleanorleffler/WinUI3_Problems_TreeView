# WinUI3_Problems_TreeView

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating two TreeViews in both UWP and WinUI3 Desktop.
The first TreeView contains TreeViewNodes and the second TreeView contains TreeViewNodes and TagTreeViewNodes (derived from TreeViewNode).

The UWP sample code does not break and works as expected. However, the WinUI3 Desktop sample code breaks as it tries to display the second TreeView.
