TreeView using inherited TreeViewNodes causes crash in WinUI3 Desktop.
TreeView using inherited TreeViewNodes works in UWP.

**Steps to reproduce the bug**

1. Checkout WinUI project. ** insert link here**
2. Open the TreeViewWinUI solution.
3. Build Debug x64.
4. You should see that an exception was thrown. See Screenshot #1 for details.

**Expected behavior**

We expect the TreeView using inherited TreeViewNodes to behave as it does in UWP. 

We expect to see two TreeViews - one on the left and another on the right. 

See Screenshot #2 for exact expected behavior. See UWP solution. **Insert link/folder path**

**Additional context**

 Extra debugging
 - If we collapse treeView1, the application still crashes.
	To replicate this, change the Visibility on line 34 in MainWindow.xaml to "Collapsed".
	Line 34: `Visibility="Collapsed"/>`
 
 - However, if we collapse treeView2, the application runs, but does not display the TreeView with the inherited TreeViewNodes.
	To replicate this, change the Visibility on line 40 in MainWindow.xaml to "Collapsed".
	Line 40: `Visibility="Collapsed"/>`
